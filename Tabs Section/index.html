              Ice Age means it is so cold that when the moisture evaporates from
              the ocean goes to the cloud, it doesn't rain it snows. In the snow
              snow falls and then it stays but the ocean is getting drained
              faster than they are getting replenished so during the Ice Age,
              The ocean levels dropped exposing the Bering Strait land bridge
              between Asia and what is now Alaska. Our ancestors who come out of
              Africa go into Europe, some stay, Others kept wandering. They keep
              walking because there is a land bridge there. They don't even know
              it is a bridge, it's just more land so they walk and they enter
              North America. The Ice Age ends, ocean levels rise, closing the
              land bridge, stranding a branch of the human species.

              A Magpie is cleaning themselves using a mirror. These birds are
              known for how smart it is. There was a water bottle. it was full.
              Magpie goes over and sips out the water, but the the beak was an
              inch and a half long at most so it goes in until it can’t reach
              the water anymore. So what does it do? It goes off to the side,
              gets a rock, just the right size, drops it into the water
              bottle.There by displacing water so it now comes and it goes back,
              it gets another stone, drops it in and everytime it drops it in
              the water level rises. It can drink more water. It keeps doing
              this. Everytime we study animals, they’re smarter than we ever
              thought they were. So maybe for our own ego, We kept building
              ourselves up, saying how separate and distinct we are as humans in
              the animal kingdom. When maybe we’re not separate and distinct as
              we think we are.

              Human Beings, especially in Africa, had achieved an insanely high
              level of sophistication. What they had done in Egypt is still to
              this day, one of the most confusing things that anyone’s ever been
              able to accomplish. There’s distinct evidence of a very advanced
              culture and it existed all over the world. There's these stone
              structures that are so complex that we don’t know who did them. We
              don’t know how they moved them and all this evidence seems to
              point to that at one point in time, human beings had reached a
              very high level of sophistication for design, for construction for
              ability to move stones and cut them like it’s really high levels
              of construction. You’re getting all these stones to meet perfectly
              at the top of a massive Pyramid. That’s 2.3M stones. Mind boggling
