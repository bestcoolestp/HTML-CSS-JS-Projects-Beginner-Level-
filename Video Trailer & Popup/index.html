      <h1>How smart it is!</h1>
      <p>
        A Magpie is cleaning themselves using a mirror. These birds are known
        for how smart it is. There was a water bottle. it was full. Magpie goes
        over and sips out the water, but the beak was an inch and a half long at
        most so it goes in until it can’t reach the water anymore. So what does
        it do? It goes off to the side, gets a rock, just the right size, drops
        it into the water bottle.There by displacing water so it now comes and
        it goes back, it gets another stone, drops it in and every time it drops
        it in the water level rises. It can drink more water. It keeps doing
        this. Every time we study animals, they’re smarter than we ever thought
        they were. So maybe for our own ego, We kept building ourselves up,
        saying how separate and distinct we are as humans in the animal kingdom.
        When maybe we’re not separate and distinct as we think we are
